This repository is for the paper introduced in the following paper

Kai Li, Zhengming Ding, Kunpeng Li, Yulun Zhang, and Yun Fu, "Support Neighbor Loss for Person Re-Identification", ACM Multimedia (ACM MM) 2018, [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06030) 

## Environment
Python 3 + PyTorch 3.0

## Data preparation 
Please refer [this repo](https://github.com/huanghoujing/person-reid-triplet-loss-baseline) for the data preparation and modify the data locations accordingly in the train.sh and test.sh files.


## Train
